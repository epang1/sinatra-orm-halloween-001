# Halloween Candy!

This year you're giving out virtual candy, which doesn't taste great, but it also keeps kids lean and fit so they can outrun the rising tides from global warming.

You're creating a web application that will show all the houses in a neighborhood, and allow a kid to trick-or-treat at a house and get candy in their bucket.

This will be challenging! There's a lot to do here. Think carefully about the model associations. You will need to create migrations, create models, and build the Sinatra app for the domain model from scratch. Then you will need to build out the routes and views.

# Tasks

1. Work from the model specs first. Implement them one at a time.
2. Create migrations as needed.
3. Run `rake db:seed`.
3. Work on the non-bonus controller specs next.

Bonuses!

1. Implement the other bonus controller specs
2. Implement the routes and views that will allow you to add/edit houses
3. Implement a new, fun feature! My suggestion is that a given house can be haunted, and when you trick-or-treat there, a ghost freaks you out and you drop all your candy!
